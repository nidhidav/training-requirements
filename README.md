# Skill Assessments

This repository contains the instructions and data necessary for completing the skill assessments required for each project. Fork this repository (see image below), complete the instructions in the README file within each relevant folder, and then send Henry the link to your copy of the repository when you are done. 

**NOTE**: In general, all commits should be made locally and then pushed to GitHub for these assessments. Files should not be directly uploaded to github via the browser. No submissions will be accepted if they have commits such as "Add files via upload" which indicate version control was not properly used.

This repository contains the instructions and data necessary for completing the required skill assessments for each project. Each folder is named after the assessment it provides -- complete the instructions in the README file within each relevant folder and then send Henry the results when you are done. 

If you run into any issues, feel free to reach out for help over Slack. Once you complete assessment, please be available to help others! We cannot succeed without working together. 

For anything related to `R`, you can check out the free online bigbioinformatics.org workshops ([link](https://www.bigbioinformatics.org/workshops))!

For learning `R` and `Python`, you can use DataCamp (you should have access -- ask Henry if not). There are relevant courses covering all areas of training! Link: https://www.datacamp.com/
